//This demo allows you to control the center turtle using the keyboard arrow keys, at the same time, the other turtle will continuously follow the turtle you are driving around.


//This demo is using the tf2 library to create three coordinate frames: a world frame, a turtle1 frame, and a turtle2 frame. This tutorial uses a tf2 broadcaster to publish the turtle coordinate frames and a tf2 listener to compute the difference in the turtle frames and move one turtle to follow the other.
