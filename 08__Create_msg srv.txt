//Introduction to msg and srv
msg: msg files are simple text files that describe the fields of a ROS message. They are used to generate source code for messages in different languages.

srv: an srv file describes a service. It is composed of two parts: a request and a response. The two parts are separated by a '---' line. Here is an example of a srv file:

int64 A
int64 B
---
int64 Sum



//Creating a message
//Just follow the tutorials. 


//Using rosmsg
$ rosmsg show beginner_tutorials/Num
--- int64 num
//Through this command can we know what is in this msg.



//Creating a service
//Just follow the tutorials. 


$ roscp [package_name] [file_to_copy_with] [copy_path]
e.g.
$ roscp rospy_tutorials AddTwoInts.srv srv/AddTwoInts.srv
